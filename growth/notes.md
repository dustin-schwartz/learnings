I think we are most fulfilled when we are constantly on a hero's journey. Most unhappiness comes from either getting stuck in the "refusal of the call" phase. Or trying to go on too many journey's at once and not completing any as a result.

## How to change ones mind

1. Laugh multiple times a day.
2. Meditate for a minimum of 10min every day.
3. Use your daily workout as your high stress time. Get in fight mode and get that energy out for the day.

## Chapter 5

### When you say I miss ... (something in the past)

What you're really saying is you miss the way you were then.

### Act as if your life is a movie

If your life up to this point was a movie, would you watch it? Would you call it a good movie that you would want to watch over and over? If not you're not alone. Many feel this way. Playing it safe and going through the motions.

Now what if that move wasn't over. What if that movie is only through the first 20mins, where we got to know the main character. What would the main character, you, do now to make the movie worth watching.

### Your Dreams have and Expiration Date

If you stay on your current path, all of your dreams, aspirations, goals, pounds you want to lose, trips you want to take, and changes you want to make are never going to happen.

Was it not meant to be, or did you just give up.
