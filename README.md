# Learnings
As I learn I often come across tips, tricks, snippets, resources, or just quick reminders for basic things, that I want to keep handy. This is where I'll keep those things.

- [JavaScript](learn.js)
- [Vue](vue)
- [Terminal Commands](#terminal-commands)

## Terminal Commands

- List global packages: `npm list -g --depth 0`
- Simple server or [http-serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server): `http-server ./`
